# FTUUtils

A python library to create Functional Tissue Units using celltype models and their interconnection information. Library was developed to support the NZ MBIE 12 Labours project.

### Context
Modelling the human physiology is a complex task. The complexity is not just limited to characterising the physiological processes in a quantifiable framework, but managing the models, connecting them and reusing them to represent the multiscale, spatio-temporal processes. Functional Tissue Units (FTU) provide a concept to modularize physiology, develop models and integrate them in a hierarchical and causally tractable manner.
Futher details regarding FTUs, modelling approach and functionality provided by this library are available in the [TechnicalReport](TechnicalReport.pdf).
A workflow create FTU from given interconnection of cells, their dynamics is available as a [jupyter notebook](tests/ftuworkflow.ipynb).
